    "'''Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use specific exception classes: Catch specific exception classes instead of using the generic Exception class. \n",
    "This makes the code more readable and helps to avoid catching and handling unintended exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keep exception handling separate from the main code: Use separate try-except blocks for each operation that can potentially raise an exception. \n",
    "This makes the code more readable and easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handle exceptions appropriately: Handle exceptions in an appropriate manner, depending on the situation. \n",
    "For example, if an exception occurs due to invalid user input, notify the user and prompt for valid input. If an exception occurs due to a system error, log the error and exit gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use finally block: Use finally block to execute code that needs to run regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. \n",
    "This is useful for releasing resources, closing files, or cleaning up after a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Don't ignore exceptions: Do not ignore exceptions or simply print an error message and continue. \n",
    "This can lead to unexpected behavior or difficult-to-debug issues later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use built-in functions and libraries for exception handling: Python has many built-in functions and libraries that can simplify exception handling. \n",
    "For example, the logging module can be used to log error messages to a file or stream, and the traceback module can be used to print detailed stack traces.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Avoid catching and re-raising exceptions unnecessarily: Avoid catching and re-raising exceptions unnecessarily, as this can lead to confusing stack traces and make debugging more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use custom exception classes where appropriate: Use custom exception classes to provide more information about specific error conditions. \n",
    "This can make it easier to handle errors in a more granular way and provide more informative error messages to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these best practices, you can write robust and maintainable code that handles exceptions effectively and gracefully.'''"
